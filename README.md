# Challenge 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description 

The motivation behind this project was to refactor the code for the webpage so that it followed Semantic HTML and make it more accessible for search engines and ensure that people with disabilities can access it using assistive technologies.

Through this project I learned which tags need to use in HTML to make the document follow semantic rules and how to consolidate code in CSS.
